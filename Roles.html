      <tr>
        <td>
          <h2 style="color: #856010;">Entry Fragger</h2> <br>
          <p>An Entry Fragger, or Fragger is typically the first one on the scene. They aren’t afraid to rush into situations or scenarios that might appear to be dangerous and they take high-risk actions that retain high rewards.

            Contrary to the name, the Fragger will not be the highest on the scoreboard. They will assist the team in executing the overall strategy and will push faster than the rest of the team.  They might be able to exchange kill for kill or leave the enemy weak enough that it can be picked up easily by the Playmaker or another role.
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2 style="color: #856010;">Support</h2> <br>
          <p>The Support is generally the person who is carrying the flashbangs, molotovs, grenades, etc. You might consider this as a staple for more or less all roles, but as there are seven competitive maps in which you will need to remember every possible position a grenade can go in and a designated team member covering this aspect of the game is useful. A Support will know the vantage points of every map, looking for ways to hinder the enemy team. Normally, they rely on the in-game leader to make calls about what to expect from the enemy team. The leader might also decide to pick up this role.
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2 style="color: #856010;">In Game Leader</h2> <br>
          <p>The IGL is responsible for calling out the overall strategy within the match. Throughout the match, they tend to call the round strategy, push objectives or locations, and also the positions that people should be in.

            The IGL will also tend not to be as high on the leader board, as their role specifically works around the team’s strategy and overall success throughout every round, their concentration will be at executing everything correctly.
          </p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <h2 style="color: #856010;">Awper</h2> <br>
          <p>The AWP (Arctic Warfare Police) can be a very dangerous weapon to play with on your team due to the cost. If a team is letting the clock run down or at the end of a round, they tend to pick the AWP up if needed.

            This role can be very dependent on the IGL. For example, the IGL might make certain calls to the AWP to move to a certain location, refrain from rushing in with the group in case the enemy team is flanking from behind, or to clear the objective location from afar.
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2 style="color: #856010;">Lurker</h2> <br>
          <p>The Lurker, as the name would imply, is someone that waits patiently and uses the environment to their advantage. Slow with movements but fast with communication, the Lurker would be responsible for letting his team know about the enemy’s positions.

            They tend to take a different route from the rest of the team, and they will be the ones that take a longer route to the objective, taking the longest in getting there due to their sneaky nature.
